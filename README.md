Raw trajectory files used for the 
anisotropic tutorial of [nmrformd](https://nmrformd.readthedocs.io).
The GROMACS input files and topology are also given.

The system is made of 602 ($\text{TIP4P}-\epsilon$) water molecules
in a slit silica nanopore. The trajectory was recorded
during a $10 \text{ns}$ production run performed with the open source code GROMACS
in the anisotropic NPzT ensemble using a timestep of $1 \text{fs}$.
In order to balance the charge of the surface, 20 sodium ions are
present in the slit.
The imposed was temperature $T = 300^\circ\text{K}$, and the pressure
$p = 1 \text{bar}$. The positions of the atoms were recorded in
the *prod.xtc* file every $2 \text{ps}$.
